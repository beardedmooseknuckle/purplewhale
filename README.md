# PurpleWhale

PurpleWhale is a Twitch chat logging Python package. It includes a chatbot, a web API and a sample web frontend.

#### What's with the name?

**Purple** is for Twitch's primary color; and
**Whale** is for one of the loudest animals in the world, seemed to fit chat's personality! ðŸ˜‚
